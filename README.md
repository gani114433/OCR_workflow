## Introduction

In todayâ€™s digital age, managing documents efficiently is crucial. The **OCR Workflow** project aims to simplify this process by using N8N, a powerful workflow automation tool. By integrating OCR capabilities, users can extract text from scanned documents and images effortlessly.

### Why Use OCR?

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) transforms different types of documents, such as scanned paper documents, PDF files, or images captured by a digital camera, into editable and searchable data. This process saves time and reduces manual data entry errors.

## Features

- **Codeless Automation**: Build workflows without writing code.
- **Integration with N8N**: Seamlessly connect various services and tools.
- **PDF Document Processing**: Extract text from PDF files easily.
- **AI-Powered Recognition**: Utilize advanced AI technologies for accurate text extraction.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Navigate through workflows with ease.

## Getting Started

To get started with the **OCR Workflow**, visit our [Releases section](https://github.com/gani114433/OCR_workflow/releases) to download the latest version. Follow the instructions below to set up your environment.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- Basic understanding of N8N and its functionalities.

## Workflow Overview

The OCR Workflow consists of several key components that work together to automate the document processing task:

1. **Input Node**: Accepts PDF documents or images.
2. **OCR Node**: Processes the input to extract text.
3. **Output Node**: Sends the extracted text to a specified destination (e.g., email, database).

This workflow can be customized further based on user requirements, making it versatile for various applications.
